### Create your First Python Program

Open PyCharm Editor. You can see the introductory screen for PyCharm. To create a new project, click on “Create New Project”.
You can select the location where you want the project to be created. If you don’t want to change location than keep it as it is but at least change the name from “untitled” to something more meaningful, like “FirstProject”.
PyCharm should have found the Python interpreter you installed earlier.
Next Click the “Create” Button.
